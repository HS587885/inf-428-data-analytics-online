# Detailed Module Descriptions 
## Module 1 - Introduction

### Goals
Install KNIME and Annaconda, run example work flows and programs. 

### Read
[So you wanna be a data scientist](https://mashable.com/2014/12/25/data-scientist/)  
KNIME Beginner's Luck Chapter 1  
Python Review  

### Install Sofware
[KNIME](https://www.knime.com/downloads)  
[Annaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)  

### Discuss
(5 points)  
Tell us about your self (Initial post)?  
How have you used datascience in your life?  
What are some real life example of machine learning applications?  

### Assignment 1
Software Installation and running tests and workflows (15 points)

## Module 2 - Statistics
### Goals
Summarize data using measures of typical value, Open and explore .csv files, use measures of variation, apply significance tests (t-tests, p-values),  

### Read
[Why Standard Deviation](http://www.separatinghyperplanes.com/2014/04/why-do-statisticians-use-standard.html)  
[538 Scientists Explain P-values](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/)  
[Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)  

### Discuss

Why do we use t-tests and p-values??  

Explain what a ‘single sample t-test’ and a ‘independent samples t-test’ are, give an example application for each, and explain the differences.  

What is a normal distribution?  Why do we need to know and use different types of statistical distributions?

### Assignment 2

Repeat the study on the effect of caffeine on muscle metabolism from [here](http://learntech.uwe.ac.uk/da/Default.aspx?pageid=1438)

## Module 3 - Pandas and Data Wrangling with KNIME

### Goals
Use Pandas to open and manipulate tabular data.  Use Groupby to aggregate data.  Merge and join data. 

### Read
KNIME Beginner's Luck Chapter 5  
[10 minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#min)  

### Discuss
When would you use the python Pandas library instead of a spread sheet?? 

What does the term "data wrangling mean" (you can google it).  Describe times you've had to do "data wrangling".

Describe situations where you've had to "clean" data before you used it.  What did you have to do to the data before doing numerical analysis?  

### Assignment

Running Data.  Make and plot groups from numerical columns

## Module 4 - Visualization

### Goals
Create several types of visualizations, including line plots,  Bar Chart,  Historgram, Scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Bubble Chart.  
Annotate plots.  
Create Web Visualizations for example MPLD3 and Bokeh  
### Read
KNIME Beginner's luck Chapter 3  
[Pyplot tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)  

### Discuss
For the visualization assignment you will be plotting data that is of interest to you.  Choose of a topic that is of interest to you (for example sports, economics, politics, etc.) and start a discussion about your topic, and where to find data for your topic.

What difficulties did you encounter when looking for data??  Discuss with other students and help each other find data.
 
### Assignment
Find data that is interesting to you.  
Then create 10-20 different visualizations (1 point each)- Compile your visualizations into a web presentation.   

## Module 5 - Machine Learning

### Goals
Use different types of features to descript data.  Classify data into categories.  Use regression to predict values.  Use algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Naive Baye's to classify data.   Understand the difference between Sensitivity and Specificity.  

### Read
KNIME Beginner's Luck Chapter 4  
[Baye's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Statement_of_theorem)  
[K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)  


### Discuss

How is machine learning used in real life?  

Give examples of machine learning applications that use classification, give examples of machine learning applications that use regression.  

If you were designing a classification system to detect whether an animal is a elephant or a mouse what features would you use?

If you were designing a classification system to detect whether an animal is a dog or a cat what features would you use?? If it more difficult to teach a computer the difference between a elephant and a mouse, compared to the difference between a dog and a cat?? 
 

### Assignment
K-Nearest Neighbor Assignment  
Baseball Prediction Assignment
