### Discuss
For the visualization assignment you will be plotting data that is of interest to you.  Choose of a topic that is of interest to you (for example sports, economics, politics, etc.) and start a discussion about your topic, and where to find data for your topic. 
### Assignment
Find data that is interesting to you.  
Then create 10-20 different visualizations (1 point each)- Compile your visualizations into a web presentation.   

## Module 5 - Machine Learning

### Goals
Use different types of features to descript data.  Classify data into categories.  Use regression to predict values.  Use algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Naive Baye's to classify data.   Understand the difference between Sensitivity and Specificity.
