Purpose of assignment: Learn to create groups from numerical columns.  Useful for situations when the dataset does not already have obvious categories to make groups.

2.  Group the runners by age groups (0-19,20-29,30-39,40-49,50-59,60-69,70-79,80+) in KNIME and in IPython look at the examples [KNIME Groupby]() and [Python Groupby]() for hints.
